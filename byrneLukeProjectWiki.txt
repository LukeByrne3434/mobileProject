This is a wiki to explain to user how to use the program.
The user is presented with a beautifully designed interface where
they are prompted to enter their first and last name along with their
age and gender. They can from there proceed to complete a BMI(bodymass index)
calculation to add to their information profile which can be accessed from 
the calculator page or the homepage. They can also choose to "Go for a run?" 
which will bring them to a page where they can check the weather at that time,
this was originally planned to be a step counter/tracker however the API would 
not co-operate and this had to be changed to a weather API at the last minute.
The final page of the program allows you to view your "profile" which is a 
compilation of all the information gathered and calculated thus far.
